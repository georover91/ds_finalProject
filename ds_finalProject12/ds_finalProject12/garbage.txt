Danger foreseen is half avoided.
Dreams go by contraries.
Friend to all is a friend to none.
Go to vintage without baskets.
Good name is better than a golden girdle.
Good words cost nothing.
He is lifeless that is faultless.
He that can make a fire well can end a quarrel.
Hog in armour is still but a hog.
Honey catches more flies than vinegar.
Non but a wise man can employ leisure well.
Secret of success is constancy to purpose.
